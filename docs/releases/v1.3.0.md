# v1.3.0 Doric

Released: 2025-12-13

## Summary

Doric adds AI image generation, a VSCode-like file browser, and media viewing capabilities to the dashboard.

## New Features

- **0054 - Generate Image Tool**: New `codev generate-image` command for AI image generation using Gemini Nano Banana Pro model. Supports text prompts, reference images (up to 14), and multiple resolutions/aspect ratios.

- **0055 - Dashboard File Browser**: VSCode-like "Files" tab with collapsible tree navigation. Browse project files directly in the dashboard, click to open in annotation viewer. Includes expand/collapse all controls.

- **0053 - af open Image/Video Support**: View images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP, SVG) and videos (MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI) directly in the dashboard with zoom controls and dimension display.

## Improvements

- Added Cheatsheet link to Projects view header
- Removed redundant "Open File" button (Files tab replaces it)
- Improved server argument parsing with Commander
- Added RELEASE protocol for standardized release process

## Breaking Changes

- Removed `af tower` command - use `codev tower` instead (tower is cross-project, not repo-specific)

## Housekeeping

- Removed legacy `agent-farm/` directory (canonical source is `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/`)
- Abandoned specs:
  - 0017 (Platform Portability Layer) - dual-write CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md is sufficient
  - 0024 (Builder Event Notifications) - manual `af send` is sufficient

## Migration Notes

If you were using `af tower`, switch to `codev tower`:
```bash
# Before
af tower start

# After
codev tower start
```
