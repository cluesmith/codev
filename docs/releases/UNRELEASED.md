# Unreleased

<!--
  TEMPLATE — copy to docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md at the start of each release cycle:

      cp docs/releases/UNRELEASED.template.md docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md

  Edit UNRELEASED.md across the cycle (the working copy). NEVER edit this
  template directly — it's the cold-start structure, untouched between cycles.

  Per-PR architect workflow (on the docs/vscode-changelog branch):
    1. cd worktrees/changelog                       # no fetch / no rebase — branches diverge by design
    2. Add the CHANGELOG entry to apps/vscode/CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
       (add the [Unreleased] heading if it's missing — post-release state removes it)
    3. Add the matching release-notes entry to UNRELEASED.md under the right section:
         substantive change → its own ## section
         small vscode item  → Polish
         non-vscode change  → Other fixes
    4. Commit both files together; plain `git push` (fast-forward, no force)

  Why no rebase, ever: main moves with code merges, docs/vscode-changelog moves
  with changelog/release-notes entries — neither branch touches the other's
  files, so they diverge by design and reconcile at release time via merge.
  Rebasing rewrites commit hashes and forces force-pushes for zero real benefit.

  At release time:
    1. Rename the title to `# vX.Y.Z <Codename>` and add `Released: YYYY-MM-DD`
    2. Replace this entire comment block with the release Summary paragraph
       (one paragraph framing what shipped — lead with the biggest story)
    3. Fill in the Contributors section at the bottom
    4. git mv docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md docs/releases/vX.Y.Z-<codename>.md
    5. Commit, plain push, merge to main alongside the version bump
    6. Re-cp the template back to UNRELEASED.md to start the next cycle

## Polish

<!-- Small vscode items as bullets:
       - **<Headline>** (#<issue>, PR #<pr>). <One short paragraph of context.>
     Move out to its own ## section if the entry grows past ~3 sentences. -->

## Other fixes (dashboard, porch, infrastructure)

- **Monorepo layout: end-user surfaces move to `apps/`** (#855, PR #1188). `packages/vscode` is now `apps/vscode` and `packages/dashboard` is now `apps/web`; shared libraries (`packages/core`, `packages/codev`, `packages/types`, `packages/config`, `packages/artifact-canvas`) stay in `packages/`. Contributors and downstream tools referencing the old paths (git submodules, editor bookmarks, `.vscode/launch.json` fragments) may need to update. No user-facing behavior change — the VS Code Marketplace bundle stays `cluesmith.codev-vscode`, the CLI is unaffected, and `workspace:*` deps resolve by package name not path. A new CI step type-checks `apps/vscode` before its unit tests run, so future tsconfig-extends regressions of the class this move surfaced are caught in CI.

- **TypeScript unified at 6.0.3 across the monorepo** (#1187, PR #1193). All workspace packages now pin TypeScript through a single pnpm catalog entry, ending the 5.7/5.9 drift between packages. Contributor-facing only: no runtime or user-visible behavior change. As part of the upgrade, `artifact-canvas` moved its bundler from tsup to tsdown with correct dual-format ESM/CJS output.

<!-- Non-vscode work that ships in the npm release. Same bullet shape as Polish. -->

## Breaking changes

None.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @cluesmith/codev@X.Y.Z
afx tower stop && afx tower start
```

The VS Code extension ships separately via the Marketplace — `Codev` extension by `cluesmith.codev`, version `X.Y.Z`.
