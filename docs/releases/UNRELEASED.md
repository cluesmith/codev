# Unreleased

<!--
  TEMPLATE — copy to docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md at the start of each release cycle:

      cp docs/releases/UNRELEASED.template.md docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md

  Edit UNRELEASED.md across the cycle (the working copy). NEVER edit this
  template directly — it's the cold-start structure, untouched between cycles.

  Per-PR architect workflow (on the docs/vscode-changelog branch):
    1. cd worktrees/changelog                       # no fetch / no rebase — branches diverge by design
    2. Add the CHANGELOG entry to packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased]
       (add the [Unreleased] heading if it's missing — post-release state removes it)
    3. Add the matching release-notes entry to UNRELEASED.md under the right section:
         substantive change → its own ## section
         small vscode item  → Polish
         non-vscode change  → Other fixes
    4. Commit both files together; plain `git push` (fast-forward, no force)

  Why no rebase, ever: main moves with code merges, docs/vscode-changelog moves
  with changelog/release-notes entries — neither branch touches the other's
  files, so they diverge by design and reconcile at release time via merge.
  Rebasing rewrites commit hashes and forces force-pushes for zero real benefit.

  At release time:
    1. Rename the title to `# vX.Y.Z <Codename>` and add `Released: YYYY-MM-DD`
    2. Replace this entire comment block with the release Summary paragraph
       (one paragraph framing what shipped — lead with the biggest story)
    3. Fill in the Contributors section at the bottom
    4. git mv docs/releases/UNRELEASED.md docs/releases/vX.Y.Z-<codename>.md
    5. Commit, plain push, merge to main alongside the version bump
    6. Re-cp the template back to UNRELEASED.md to start the next cycle

## Polish

<!-- Small vscode items as bullets:
       - **<Headline>** (#<issue>, PR #<pr>). <One short paragraph of context.>
     Move out to its own ## section if the entry grows past ~3 sentences. -->

- **PR sidebar sorts by ownership, with a `(draft)` badge** (#787, PR #1019). The Pull Requests view used to render PRs in arbitrary forge order with no fast scan-path to the ones you'd authored or were asked to review, and no way to distinguish drafts. It now groups into one flat list ordered mine → review-requested → others, newest-first within each bucket; drafts carry a `(draft)` suffix and a draft icon. Two new fields (`reviewRequests`, `isDraft`) flow end-to-end through the forge concept; github + gitlab fully populate, gitea safely defaults because `tea pulls list` doesn't expose the fields. When `gh` is unavailable the list falls back to plain createdAt-desc with no crash.

## Other fixes (dashboard, porch, infrastructure)

<!-- Non-vscode work that ships in the npm release. Same bullet shape as Polish. -->

## Breaking changes

None.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @cluesmith/codev@X.Y.Z
afx tower stop && afx tower start
```

The VS Code extension ships separately via the Marketplace — `Codev` extension by `cluesmith.codev`, version `X.Y.Z`.
